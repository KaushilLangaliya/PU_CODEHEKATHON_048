Creating a pilot campaign for the saree business in Surat‚Äôs Chauta Bazaar, focusing on small-scale digital marketing to build trust, will need a structured approach. Below is a step-by-step plan for launching a pilot campaign for a saree retailer.

Objective of the Pilot Campaign
Goal: Increase footfall and sales for the selected saree store.
Target: Attract 50‚Äì100 new potential customers in 2 weeks.
Budget: ‚Çπ5,000‚Äì‚Çπ10,000 (adjustable based on store owner‚Äôs comfort level).
Step 1: Audience Identification
Focus on local customers and tourists from nearby cities like Delhi and Ahmedabad who visit Surat for saree shopping.

Demographics:

Age: 25‚Äì45 years
Location: Surat and surrounding areas, specifically tourists who come to Chauta Bazaar
Interests: Fashion, ethnic wear, festivals, weddings, and special occasions
Psychographics:

Individuals looking for premium quality sarees at reasonable prices.
Customers who value craftsmanship and heritage in their purchases.
Step 2: Social Media Platforms
Primary Platform: Instagram and Facebook (since they are visual platforms and ideal for showcasing saree designs).
Secondary Platform: WhatsApp (for direct customer communication and catalog sharing).
Step 3: Campaign Components
Visual Content:
Photos and Short Videos: Showcase the sarees in different settings (on mannequins, worn by models, or at events). Ensure high-quality images with close-ups of intricate designs.
Behind-the-Scenes: Feature the craftsmanship and heritage of the saree-making process. This adds value to the story.
Customer Testimonials: Encourage customers to share photos of themselves wearing the sarees and tag the store in their posts.
Ad Copy (Text):
Highlight unique selling points: "Handcrafted, timeless sarees for every occasion."
Feature limited-time offers, e.g., ‚ÄúExclusive festive collection now available in-store. Visit us today and get a 10% discount on your first purchase.‚Äù
Address the local community: ‚ÄúJoin hundreds of satisfied customers from Surat and beyond!‚Äù
Call-to-Action (CTA):
Encourage people to visit the store with phrases like: "Hurry, limited stock available!" or "Book a free styling consultation today."
Include "DM for more details" or "Call us on WhatsApp to view our full collection."
Step 4: Campaign Execution
Create Social Media Ads:

Instagram/Facebook Stories & Posts: Create 4-5 posts and stories over a 2-week period. Each post can be about a different saree collection or feature customer testimonials.
Ad Budget Allocation:
‚Çπ3,000 for Instagram/Facebook Ads targeting Surat and nearby cities.
Split the budget over 10 days: ‚Çπ300/day for ads.
Focus on local awareness and interest targeting (e.g., users interested in sarees, fashion, ethnic wear, weddings).
Google My Business:

Optimize the store‚Äôs listing with photos, hours of operation, and promotions. Include a link to the store‚Äôs WhatsApp for easy customer interaction.
WhatsApp Catalog:

Create a digital catalog showcasing a selection of sarees with prices and brief descriptions.
Promote this catalog via WhatsApp and social media, providing customers a chance to browse before visiting.
In-Store Signage:

Place a QR code in the store that links to the WhatsApp catalog. Encourage walk-in customers to scan it for additional information or offers.
Step 5: Track Campaign Metrics
Key Metrics:

Number of new customers who engage with the store‚Äôs social media.
Number of people who reach out via WhatsApp for more details.
Foot traffic in-store (if possible, track the impact on footfall).
Direct sales from the campaign (i.e., how many customers mention they saw the ad).
Engagement:

Monitor likes, shares, and comments on the campaign posts.
Track the number of inquiries or sales from the WhatsApp catalog.
Step 6: Customer Feedback and Adjustments
After the Pilot:
Get feedback from the customers: What caught their attention? How did they hear about the store?
Adjust ad targeting and content for future campaigns based on what worked.
Sample Timeline for 2-Week Campaign
Day 1‚Äì3: Post initial campaign photos of the store, showcasing its unique saree collection.
